# Bawa Chat Application

Bawa is a WhatsApp clone that allows users to communicate through messaging, sharing files, and images within the same group. It is designed to demonstrate core chat functionalities like sending text messages, sharing images, and files across multiple clients connected to the same group or chat room.

## Features

- **Group Messaging**: Users can join the same group chat and exchange messages in real-time.
- **File Sharing**: Send and receive various file types, including documents, PDFs, and more.
- **Image Sharing**: Seamlessly share images between clients in a group chat.
- **Client Interface**: Includes two clients (Client 1 and Client 2) that simulate user interactions within the chat environment.
- **Real-time Communication**: Messages and media are delivered instantly within the group.
